## Flutter's initial learning on MacOS and iOS(XCode).

### For the time being, the development environment (repository) will be managed separately on Windows and MacOS.

#### Development policy
Wired (USB) connection tests of real Android and iOS devices are also performed, but the test development environment mainly checks operation on emulators.
