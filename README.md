and
## Flutter's initial learning on MacOS and iOS(XCode).

### For the time being, the development environment (repository) will be managed separately on Windows and MacOS.
### This is for MacOS's one(but for both Android and iOS).

#### Development policy
Wired (USB) connection tests of real Android and iOS devices are also performed, but the test development environment mainly checks operation on emulators.

- Written Dart code.
- Leveraged an external, third-party library.
- Used hot reload for a faster development cycle.
- Implemented a stateful widget.
- Created a lazily loaded, infinite scrolling list.

- Implement interactivity by adding a clickable heart icon to save favorite pairings.
- Implement navigation to a new route by adding a new screen containing the saved favorites.
- Modify the theme color, making an all-white app.
